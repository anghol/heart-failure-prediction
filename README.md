# Heart failure prediction
This educational project was completed as part of a course "Probability theory and mathematical statistics" at TulSU in 2023.

The main goal is to create binary classification model to predict heart failure.

# Dataset
This dataset from Kaggle was used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

It contains 12 clinical features for predicting heart disease events.

# Tasks
1. Perform exploratory data analysis
2. Find outliers and delete them
3. Select significant features
4. Preprocess data to pass into models
5. Create models for binary classification: logistic regression, neural network
